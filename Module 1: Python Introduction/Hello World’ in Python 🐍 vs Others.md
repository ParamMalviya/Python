### **Python**:
- **Code**:
  ```python
  print("Hello World")
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - Python uses the `print` function, which is simple and resembles plain English.
  - No need for header files, main functions, or additional syntax.
  - Python's simplicity is one of its major advantages, contributing to its popularity.

### **C Language**:
- **Code**:
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
      printf("Hello World");
      return 0;
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - Requires including header files like `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions.
  - The `main` function is necessary as the entry point for execution.
  - `printf` is a predefined function to print text, and its definition is in the header file.
  - Explicitly needs a `return` statement and proper structuring with braces.

### **Java**:
- **Code**:
  ```java
  public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
      }
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - Requires a class (`HelloWorld` in this example), as Java is object-oriented.
  - The `main` method serves as the entry point for execution.
  - `System.out.println` is used to print the text.
  - Compared to Python, Java requires more boilerplate code.

---

### **Comparison**:
- Python:
  - Minimal syntax, easier for beginners.
  - Dynamically typed and highly flexible.
- C:
  - Structured and lower-level, requiring more manual declarations.
- Java:
  - Verbose and strictly object-oriented.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Python's simplicity and reduced lines of code make it more beginner-friendly and versatile, a key reason for its growing popularity.
